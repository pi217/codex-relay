# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This pnpm monorepo contains a mobile Codex client backed by a local server. `apps/mobile` is the Expo React Native app, with routes in `src/app`, UI in `src/components`, state in `src/state`, API helpers in `src/lib`, and assets in `assets`. `packages/codex-relay` contains the Hono Node server in `src`, Vitest tests in `test`, and shared Zod API contracts in `src/api-schema.ts`. Treat `dogfood-output*` as generated artifacts.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm install`: install workspace dependencies with pnpm 10.
- `pnpm dev`: run the local server with `tsx watch`; it listens on port `8787`.
- `pnpm dev:server`: run the local server with `tsx watch`; it listens on port `8787`.
- `pnpm dev:mobile`: start Expo Metro for a development client.
- `pnpm dev:mobile:ios` / `pnpm dev:mobile:android`: build and run the native dev client.
- `pnpm lint`: run oxlint plus oxfmt checks across `apps` and `packages`.
- `pnpm lint:fix`: apply oxlint fixes and format the repo.
- `pnpm typecheck`: run `tsc --noEmit` in every package.
- `pnpm test`: run the server Vitest suite.

## Working Alongside Another Agent

When more than one agent works on this repository at once (for example Claude
Code and Cowork), coordinate through the agent bus instead of leaving the other
side to guess. Run `pnpm agent-bus init` once to switch it on; without `.coop/`
the bus stays inert.

- Read your inbox before starting: `pnpm -s agent-bus drain --agent <you>`.
  Claude Code does this automatically through its `SessionStart` hook.
- Post a `task`, `result`, `question`, or `answer` when the other agent needs to
  know something: `pnpm -s agent-bus post --from <you> --to <them> ...`.
- Claim files before editing shared code, and run
  `pnpm -s agent-bus check --agent <you> --path <path>` before touching files you
  did not claim. A non-zero exit means someone else owns them.

See [docs/agent-bus.md](./docs/agent-bus.md) for the full protocol.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use TypeScript throughout. Formatting is owned by `oxfmt`; do not hand-format around it. The current style uses two-space indentation, double quotes, trailing commas where added, and ESM imports. React components use `PascalCase` file and export names, hooks use `use-*` file names and `useX` functions, and helpers use `camelCase`. Keep shared API shapes in `packages/codex-relay/src/api-schema.ts`.

## Mobile UI Primitives

Prefer established UI primitives over hand-rolling fragile React Native layouts.

- For any mobile bottom sheet, use `AppBottomSheet` and `SheetActionRow` from `apps/mobile/src/components/ui/bottom-sheet.tsx`.
- Do not create ad hoc `Modal` + dimmer + nested `Pressable` sheet structures in feature components.
- Do not position bottom sheet row text with `absolute`; keep rows as icon/text/trailing columns through `SheetActionRow`.
- Put spacing, safe-area padding, dimmer behavior, accessibility roles, and iOS layout fixes inside reusable primitives rather than duplicating them per screen.
- If a new screen needs a layout pattern that is likely to recur, add or extend a UI primitive first, then compose the feature screen from that primitive.
- After changing mobile UI primitives or their callers, capture the affected screen in the iOS simulator or device when practical, especially for modals, bottom sheets, keyboard-adjacent UI, and compact controls.

## Testing Guidelines

Server tests use Vitest and live in `packages/codex-relay/test` with `*.test.ts` names. Add focused route or schema coverage when changing API behavior, validation, streaming, or thread state. Run `pnpm test`, then `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before handing off broader changes. Mobile code currently relies on typechecking and manual/dev-client verification; document any device or simulator checks in the PR.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

The short Git history uses simple Conventional Commit-style messages such as `chore: oxlint, oxfmt`; prefer `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, or `test:` with an imperative summary. PRs should include a brief description, validation commands run, linked issue if applicable, and screenshots or screen recordings for mobile UI changes. Mention configuration changes such as `EXPO_PUBLIC_CODEX_RELAY_SERVER_URL` or `CODEX_RELAY_WORKSPACE_PATH`.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit local secrets, device-specific URLs, or generated native build output. Physical devices usually need `EXPO_PUBLIC_CODEX_RELAY_SERVER_URL=http://<host-lan-ip>:8787`; simulators and web can use the default `127.0.0.1` value.
